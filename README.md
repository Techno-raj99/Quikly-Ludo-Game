# Quikly-Ludo-Game
The objective of Ludo is to be the first player to move all of their tokens from the starting position to the home position. Players take turns rolling a six-sided dice to determine how many spaces they can move their tokens. The tokens move in a clockwise direction along the outer track of the board, following the numbered squares.
